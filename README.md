# Python

    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility in fields like web development, data science, automation, and more.

### Why do use python over other:
- Simple and Readable Syntax – Easy to learn and write, even for beginners.
- Versatile – Used in web development, data science, AI/ML, automation, scripting, etc.
- Large Standard Library – Built-in modules for many tasks without external packages.
- Massive Community Support – Active community means more tutorials, solutions, and libraries.
- Cross-Platform – Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without major changes.
- Rapid Development – Less code, faster prototyping, and quick implementation.
- Integration-Friendly – Easily integrates with C/C++, Java, .NET, and web services.
- Popular in Industry and Academia – Widely used by top companies and in research.
- Support for Multiple Paradigms – Procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
- Great for Automation and Scripting – Perfect for repetitive tasks and workflow automation.


### Ways to Run Python Code
- python script.py – Run a Python script.
- python -c "command" – Run inline Python code.
- python -m module – Run a Python module as a script.
- python -i script.py – Run a script and enter interactive mode afterward.


### Source Code Encoding
    - Python source files default to UTF-8 encoding.
    - To use a different encoding, declare it at the top:
            # -*- coding: cp1252 -*-
    - If using a shebang line (#!/usr/bin/env python3), place the encoding on the second line.
    - Prompts with >>> (primary) and ... (secondary).
