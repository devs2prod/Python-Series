# Variable
    Variables in Python are names that store data. Think of a variable as a label for a value.
    Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
    Variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
    Variable names are case-sensitive.
    We can 

## Types of datatype:

#### Primitive data type:
- int
- str
- float
- bool
- none

#### Collection data type:
- list
- tuple
- set
- dict

## Rules for declaring the variables:
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

## Types of case:
- Camel-case: Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter
- Pascal-case: Each word starts with a capital letter
- Snake-case: Each word is separated by an underscore character


### Casting the Variable:
- int() -- used to convert into int
- str() -- used to convert into string 
- float() -- used to convert into floating number
